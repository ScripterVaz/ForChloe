    <h2>Dear Chloe,</h2>
    <p>
      I like you a lot, and I truly regret what I did with Nicoly. I should have never done something like that.
      You mean so much to me. You make my day brighter just by being in it. You're kind, beautiful, and honestly one of the best people I know.
    </p>
    <p>I hope this shows how much I care about you.</p>
